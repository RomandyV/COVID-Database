# COVID-Database
For my 3rd project for my CIS 162 (Computer Science I) class I completed an unfinished program for a COVID-database. The program reads data from an .csv file which the data can filter according to some specifications. I added a little bit to the GUI part.

# What I learned:
- Try-catch statement
- How to read from/scan data from a file
- Some GUI stuff like creating a button and naming it
- ArrayList class
